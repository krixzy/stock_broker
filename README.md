Stock Broker

Stock Broker is an experimental project that explores how intelligent an AI can become in stock trading using machine learning. The project focuses on developing, training, and testing different trading strategies based on historical stock data.

Purpose

Build an AI that can simulate stock trading based on historical data.

Experiment with different ML models to predict price movements.

Test the AI's trading strategies by running simulations with virtual money.

Learn about stock trading and machine learning through practical experimentation.

Features

Data Collection: Retrieves historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.

Data Processing: Cleans and analyzes data to identify patterns.

Machine Learning: Trains models to predict future price movements.

Trading Strategy: Simulates trades based on AI predictions.

Evaluation: Tests and optimizes strategies to improve AI performance.

Technologies

Python: Main language for data handling and modeling.

yfinance: Used for retrieving stock data.

pandas & NumPy: For data processing.

scikit-learn & TensorFlow: For machine learning.

Matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.

Future Development

Implement reinforcement learning to optimize strategies.

Integrate real-time data to simulate live trading.

Expand to support additional asset classes such as cryptocurrencies or commodities.
